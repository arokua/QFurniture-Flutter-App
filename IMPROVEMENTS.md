# QFurniture App Improvements

## Overview
The QFurniture app has been revamped with a focus on smooth product browsing experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Product Browsing
- **Grid and List Views**: Toggle between grid and list views for different browsing preferences
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across product names, descriptions, and SKUs
- **Category Filtering**: Quick filter by product categories with chip-based UI
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Optimized list rendering for smooth scrolling performance

### 2. Image Handling
- **Image Caching**: Uses `cached_network_image` for efficient image loading and caching
- **Multiple Images**: Support for product image galleries
- **Placeholder Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing or failed image loads
- **Optimized Loading**: Progressive image loading with loading indicators

### 3. Product Detail Screen
- **Image Gallery**: Swipeable image gallery with page indicators
- **Better Layout**: Modern Material 3 design with sliver app bar
- **Variant Display**: Clear display of product variants with stock status
- **Enhanced Information**: Better organization of product details, SKU, and categories

### 4. Product Model Updates
- **Multiple Images**: Support for image arrays
- **SKU Field**: Added SKU field for product identification
- **Flexible Data**: Better support for WooCommerce data structure

### 5. WooCommerce Integration Script
- **Python Script**: `fetch_woocommerce_products.py` to fetch products from WooCommerce
- **Image Download**: Automatically downloads and renames images by SKU and ID
- **JSON Generation**: Creates properly formatted `products.json` for the app
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect server resources

## New Dependencies

Added to `pubspec.yaml`:
- `cached_network_image: ^3.3.1` - For efficient image caching
- `http: ^1.2.0` - For network requests (if needed)
- `shimmer: ^3.0.0` - For loading placeholders (optional, can be added later)
